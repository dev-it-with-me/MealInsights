**[DEPRECATED] Panel C1003.IngredientFilterSortPanel**
⚠️ **DEPRECATED**: This component has been replaced by the filtering capabilities built into C1025.UnifiedItemsList which provides unified filtering for both ingredients and products. - [Link to P0100.ManageItemsPage](../MasterFile.md#page-p0100manageitemspage) - ---

**Replacement:** Use the built-in filtering features of [C1025.UnifiedItemsList](./C1025.md#listofdynamicobjects-c1025unifieditemslist) instead.
